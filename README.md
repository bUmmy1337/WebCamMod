# WebCam Bubbles Mod 

Works for Minecraft version 1.21.4


## Features

Adds a customizable pop-up (aka bubble) that displays a live image from your webcam!
Works on LAN and servers

This is a server/client mod, so it needs to be installed on both.

### New: Webcam Preview
- **Live preview overlay**: See your own webcam feed in real-time on your screen
- **Customizable position and size**: Adjust preview location and scale to your preference
- **Toggle on/off**: Enable or disable preview as needed
- **Smart visibility**: Automatically hides in third-person view (since you can see yourself anyway)
- **High performance**: Optimized for smooth gameplay without lag
- **Clean design**: Minimalist appearance without borders
- **Seamless integration**: Preview uses the same video feed as the player bubbles
